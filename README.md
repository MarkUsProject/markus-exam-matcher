![Text](./examples/student_info_num.jpg?raw=true)

Below is a sample usage that generates a prediction from the file shown above, assuming it was titled `my_example.jpg`.
```pycon
>>> from markus_exam_matcher.image_processing import read_chars
>>> from markus_exam_matcher.core import char_types
>>> prediction = read_chars.run('./my_example.jpg', char_type=char_types.CharType.DIGIT, debug=False)
>>> prediction
'0001250981'
```
